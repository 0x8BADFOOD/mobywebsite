## [In Memoriam Ian Murdock](https://blog.docker.com/2015/12/ian-murdock/)

Moby was the project [Ian Murdock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Murdock) joined Docker to implement. Many of us have worked with him during the early phases of the project. We're sad he's not here with us today to launch it!
